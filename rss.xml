			<description><![CDATA[More Chinese Virus, Covid-19 News, Payroll Protection Program sucks.04-17-20. Alexander News Show. Let's discuss? 1. The Payroll Protection Program has so far failed, Millions of Small businesses haven't received any money and all of this? Because Banks poorly administered the application process, including holding up the applications for the Small Businesses, and the Small business Administration also failing to move faster to help the Businesses, President Trump wants to give $250 billion more for Small Businesses, but Democrat Senators are holding that plan up. 2. We discussed why it's not racist to call this Virus? The Chinese Virus, 3. We discussed where the Virus came from? New report came out today, that maybe sheds more light to this, and yes? I still say, this was done in a Chinese Bio-weapons lab, 4. I have a question? Can we sue Miami Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez? And Our County Government for negligence? If a Business Owner loses his Business? Please respond with answers to my Twitter @AlexanderNewsSh.

			<description><![CDATA[More Covid-19 or Chinese Virus discussion.03-29-20. Alexander News Show. Let's discuss how awesome of a job Our Florida Governor Desantis is doing with combating the Chinese Virus, but the disgraceful Communist such as Billy Corbin will not recognize it? How about Desantis getting the Drug? Hydroxychloroquine for some Florida Hospitals. This is a game changer to fighting the Virus, this is the same Drug Trump spoke of last week, speaking of Trump? What's the Democrat Communist plan to fight the Chinese Virus? They have none, also discussed Miami Mayor Francis Suarez getting out of Quarantine. Great for him, but he's still a Demagogue. You ever heard of selected Quarantine? Selected areas of a City or County. You lockdown just selected areas, but not a entire City, you will destroy the complete economy. Let's get into Covid-19, Chinese Virus discussion. Follow Alexander News Show on Twitter @AlexanderNewsSh.

			<description><![CDATA[More Covid,19, News for, 03-23-20. Alexander News Show. We discussed? 1. Miami Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez power grab. He came out in a interview? And mentioned that its important to save lives over saving the Counties economy, not a bad way to think? Except if you use how South Korea handled the Coronavirus response? Your decision isn't warranted, because your comments about shutting most all Businesses in Miami Dade, will cause a economic catastrophe, and suicide rates will go up. Lockdown shouldn't be a option, 2. Discussed how South Korea responded to Virus? And why Lockdown doesn't work. 3. Discussed Joe Bidens press Conference today, he looked half brain dead, 4. Discussed Dr.Fauchi critiques of President Trump, wrong thing to do, especially in a time of crisis, and why there needs to be unity, plus you don't talk bad about your Boss to the Media.

			<description><![CDATA[Communism will ruin Our Culture.02-25-20. Alexander News Show. We discuss 2 Political Elections? 1. The U.S. Presidential and the Miami Dade Mayors race, with the Presidential? It's a high possibility that Bernie Sanders could win the U.S. Presidency, we have at the moment? What I describe as the Perfect Storm happening now, there is the Coronavirus, and this potential pandemic? Can disrupt the Global economy, which will disrupt the USA economy, just in the last 2 days? The stock market plunged. This Communist Bum? Is promising freebies in his gift box which I call the Communist gift box, this Communist Sanders is not shy about stating that he's a Communist and that he loves Fidel Castro, the lazies, the losers and youngsters are getting Brainwashed and have no idea that Communism has killed over 100 million People in its history, a Sanders Presidency? Will destroy America as we know it. On the local front? Miami Dade Mayors race? A Peneles or a Cava Mayoralship? Let's focus on Cava, because I believe shes got this Mayor Election in the bag, Cava will raise taxes on the Property owners and the Business owners. Let's look? There is the possibility? Of a local Climate tax, a tax to fund Affordable living? Cava is working to help the Lazies and will work to make Miami Dade a Sanctuary County, Cava isn't for the Working middle class and there's a high possibility? That a Cava Administration? Will force lots of rich businesses and big Corporations to move out of Miami Dade. We discuss all of this and other negative impacts of what a potential Mayor Cava will do to the Culture of Miami Dade. We discuss the bad that will happen of a Sanders Presidency and a bad of a Cava being Miami Dade Mayor. Alexander News Show can be followed on Twitter @AlexanderNewsSh.

The Miami Dade Mayoral Election is in 2020 and this will be a County Mayors Race focusing on Miami Dade issues such as?

I believe are the favorites to make the November, 2020, finals, which is Cava and Peneles, but of course? This doesn't mean I won't go ahead and make things interesting, by giving ideas for a particular Candidate, in this case Mr.Suarez, to try and win this Mayors Race. Look all things are possible, and I believe? Even if Mr.Suarez is the underdog in this Race? Doesn't mean, he won't have a shot and win this whole Mayors Race, especially, if he follows my ideas, recommendations. This Special Needs Fitness Guru Show?

The Miami Dade Mayoral Election is in 2020 and this will be a County Mayors Race focusing on Miami Dade issues such as? Public Transportation and Affordable Housing, this Race will have 6 Candidates for Mayor, of which 2 of them? I believe are the favorites to make the November, 2020, finals, which is Cava and Peneles, but of course? This doesn&apos;t mean I won&apos;t go ahead and make things interesting, by giving ideas for a particular Candidate, in this case Mr.Suarez, to try and win this Mayors Race. Look all things are possible, and I believe? Even if Mr.Suarez is the underdog in this Race?

			<description><![CDATA[What Public, Private Partnership? 12-18-19. Miami Dade Taxpayers once again get screwed over by the Miami Dade County Politicians, this time with a new Courthouse to be built. Under the partnership? Plenary, which Mayor Carlos Gimenez picked will front Construction cost and build the 23 story Building on a half acre owned by the County, all of this in Downtown Miami,FL. Construction is set to start in the middle of 2020 and finish by 2024, the County will repay Plenary an estimated $810 million back in annual installments, over 30 yrs. Yes there's always cost overruns. Plus Plenary will run and maintain the Courthouse during the term of which the County is repaying back the money to them. Please take this as a loan that Plenary is giving to Miami Dade, yes more then likely theres also interest on top of that. Plus Plenary will make money operating the Courthouse too. What Public, Private Partnership? This is another Curruption deal led by Mr.Gimenez and his Commission Stooges all voted in favor of this. Not one refusal vote from a Commission Member, all yes votes. In the Special Needs Fitness Guru Show we discuss this horrible deal. Please follow Alexander Carlos on Twitter @Uzfit913Spneeds.

			<description><![CDATA[Today's episode is named? Miami Dade Transit Curruption. 10-11-19. I first give kudos to at Miami Dade County Commissioners Xavier Suarez and Ms.Cava for voting No against the $72 Million $$$ for a Train Station at Aventura, Fl that will be given to Mr.Branson a Billionaire, but for the rest of the Board of County Commissioners? They all voted for this deal yes, they are a disgrace and Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez is also a disgrace for supporting and pushing this deal through, him along with his inner circle, in a time when Miami Dade Low income Families have no money to get around, there needs to be more Public transit, not a Train Station for a Billionaire. We discuss this on the Special Needs Fitness Guru Show. Please follow Alexander Carlos on Twitter @Uzfit913Spneeds.

			<title><![CDATA[ Paradoxical reaction, is the Negative reaction to antidepressants meds,02-10-19.]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[What does Paradoxical reaction mean and do? A variety of drugs can occasionally cause paradoxical reactions resulting in the induction or aggravation of the conditions they are being used to treat. They include drugs for anaesthesia, analgesia, allergy, cardiac arrhythmias, arthritis, cancer, anticoagulation, epilepsy, diarrhoea, hypertension, infection, bronchospasm, nasal congestion, Parkinson's disease, and sedation, this is the Reckless work that psychiatrists and Neurologists do, prescribe Meds, without authorizing the Patient do blood work and do a Proper mental Health evaluation. We talk about a Autism Man who had a Meltdown in Chigaco,Ill,USA, and go Physically Violent towards his Parents and what I believe this is the reason is the cause of it, this is happening in the Medical Mental health Community Profession.
